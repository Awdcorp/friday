{"timestamp": "2025-06-11T17:35:50.100856", "role": "assistant", "content": "The main difference between a deep copy and a shallow copy lies in how the copying process is done in programming:\n\n1. Shallow Copy: A shallow copy creates a new object but does not create new copies of nested objects within the original object. Instead, it copies the references to those nested objects. This means that changes made to the nested objects in the copied object will also affect the original object.\n\n2. Deep Copy: A deep copy, on the other hand, creates a completely new object and also creates new copies of all nested objects within the original object. This means that changes made to the nested objects in the copied object will not affect the original object.\n\nIn summary, a shallow copy only copies the top-level structure of an object, while a deep copy creates copies of all levels of nested objects within the original object."}
